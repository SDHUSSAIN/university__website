                <h2>Our Certificates & Online Programs for 2021</h2>
                <p>In July 2019, UIC opened its newest campus living facility. The 10-story Academic and Residential Complex, which is part of a public-private partnership, holds 550 beds in a mix of traditional dorm rooms and suite-style units. Three large
                    lecture halls, four classrooms, several small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and collaboration spaces are highlights of the facility’s academic areas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Engineering Innovation Building, which also opened in July 2019, is the first new academic building on the east side of campus since 1991. The 50,000-square-foot facility houses instructional space, research labs and faculty and staff
                    offices. The building also includes the University’s first high-bay structural research lab, where researchers can carry out a wide range of tests on large-scale structural components.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In August 2019, UIC acquired the John Marshall Law School and formed Chicago’s only public law school. Formerly an independent private school, John Marshall was founded in 1899 and for over a century upheld a tradition of diversity, innovation
                    and opportunity and provided an education that combines an understanding of the theory, the philosophy and the practice of law. The creation of UIC John Marshall Law School provides current and prospective law students with more affordable
                    education, as well as enhanced student services, such as access to health care, recreational facilities, residence halls and college athletics. There will be opportunities to take interdisciplinary courses, and new joint-degree and
                    dual-degree programs are in development. These courses and programs align with UIC’s strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and
                    business.
